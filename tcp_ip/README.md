# TCP/IP

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. 
TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).  
In other words, TCP/IP is just a set of rules and conventions network devices
follow into order to exchange data over a network (LAN or WAN).  
So the main purpose of challenge this to have a better understanding of TCP/IP
model.
